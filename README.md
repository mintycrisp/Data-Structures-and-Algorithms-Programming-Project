# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Programming-Project
This project involves creating a Java program that implements an undirected graph with a GUI using JavaFX. The program consists of four key classes: a vertex class that defines the graph's vertices, including their coordinates and labels; a graph class that manages the graph structure, allowing for the addition of vertices and edges, and includes methods to check if the graph is connected, detect cycles, and perform both depth-first and breadth-first searches; a visual display class extending the JavaFX Pane to handle the graphical representation of the graph and user interactions; and a main class that sets up the GUI, including buttons for graph operations and text fields for user input. The code should be organized into separate .java files, each with appropriate comments and documentation, and submitted as a zipped file along with a detailed project report.
